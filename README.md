# My configuration files for various things, as well as some useful scripts.
Currently a hot mess â€” will be cleaned up later

# TODO: 
* auto-commit files hardlinked in bash script

# Wayland configuration
[Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) is my current Wayland compositor.  
[Onagre](https://github.com/oknozor/onagre) is used as a launcher  
[waylock](https://github.com/ifreund/waylock) is used as a simple screenlocker.  
[i3status-rs](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust) is used as a status bar.  
wayshot is used to take screenshots.
Slurp is used to select areas of the screen for that.

Then, [xremap](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap) will be used in Wayland for application-specific key combination or key sequence remappings, while [swhkd](https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd) will be used to launch commands via keybinds (e.g. s-R to launch Onagre).


[Espanso](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso) is used as a text expander:
